## [Demographic Health Surveys of Ethiopia App](https://abernier.shinyapps.io/demographic_health_surveys_of_ethiopia/)
This dashboard was created using the Shiny Python library. It pulls data from USAID's Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) API for Ethiopia and displays it in various ways. The map is generated using the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM)'s geometry. The DHS Program has collected, analyzed, and disseminated accurate and representative data on population, health, HIV, and nutrition through more than 300 surveys in over 90 countries. GADM provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions.
The DHS API has data available for over 4500 indicators, but this dashboard focuses on a subset of 8 indicators related to electricity and water sources as it is intended to be a quick demo dashboard. These 8 indicators were selected because they are understood by a wide audience and have data for all Ethiopian regions.
